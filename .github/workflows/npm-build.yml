name: Build (NPM)

# Execute '`npm run build`' against the package.json file.  There is 
# support for package.json files that are named otherwise or do not exist 
# at the root of the repository.  This workflow *only* runs the build script.
# 
# At the end of the job, it bundles up the entire workspace into a `.tgz` 
# file for use in later jobs.  This reduces the amount of time needed to 
# run tests, security scans, or the 'npm pack' command later on.
#
# The disadvantage of separate jobs is cost.  You are billed a minimum of 
# one minute of runtime for every job in a workflow.  But the advantage is 
# the ability to perform job steps in parallel (such as tests) and process 
# isolation.
